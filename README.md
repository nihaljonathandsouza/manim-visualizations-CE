# Manim Visualization: The Infinite Chocolate Trick

This repository contains a Python script using the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) engine to animate the famous "Infinite Chocolate" geometric paradox.

## 🍫 The Concept
The animation demonstrates a geometric rearrangement where a chocolate bar is cut and reassembled, appearing to produce an extra piece of chocolate from nowhere. 

### Key Features of the Animation:
* **Dynamic Grid Generation:** Creating a 6x4 chocolate bar procedurally.
* **Complex Transformations:** Using `Transform` and `ApplyMethod` to rearrange polygon groups accurately.
* **Text Overlays:** Step-by-step storytelling using `AddTextLetterByLetter`.
